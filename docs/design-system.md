# Design System Usage

This project ships with a small design system based on Tailwind CSS and CSS variables. This guide summarizes how to use it when building new features.

For governance and enforcement workflows, read [Design System Governance](./design-governance.md).

## Onboarding quickstart

### Core tools

- React with Next.js powers the application shell.
- Tailwind CSS and CSS variables expose the design tokens documented below.
- Storybook and the `/components` gallery surface canonical component states for review.
- TypeScript keeps usage typed and encourages explicit props.

### Directory map

- `tokens/` – source of truth for tokens; `tokens.css` is generated from these definitions.
- `docs/` – system documentation (start with this file, governance, and the tokens reference).
- `src/components/` – feature components and shared primitives under `ui/`.
- `src/icons/` – curated icon set.
- `src/stories/` – Storybook stories that mirror gallery usage.

### Working agreements

- Compose new UI from tokens and primitives; avoid bespoke utility stacks.
- Honour the shared component gallery by updating examples alongside implementation work.
- Respect theme helpers, persistence, and reduced-motion preferences when adding interactions.
- Preserve keyboard and screen reader affordances: semantic landmarks, labelled controls, and visible focus remain non-negotiable.
- Keep contributions scoped and typed, running `npm run check` (tests, lint, design lint, typecheck) before requesting review.

## Tokens

- Color, radius, shadows and transitions are defined as CSS variables in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/app/themes.css`.
- Use semantic classes like `bg-background`, `text-foreground` and `ring` instead of hard-coded values.
- Pair high-chroma fills with the semantic text tokens: `text-warning-foreground` for alert banners, `text-success-foreground` for celebratory fills (including the success glow), `text-on-accent` for accent gradients, `text-accent-foreground` / `text-accent-2-foreground` for accent rails, and `text-danger-foreground` for destructive actions. This ensures the `color-contrast()` fallbacks in `themes.css` stay effective.
- If you need to introduce a new static color, map it to a token in [`COLOR_MAPPINGS.md`](../COLOR_MAPPINGS.md).
- Name color tokens in kebab-case with hyphenated numeric variants (e.g. `accent-2`).
- Input elements use `--control-radius` (16px) for consistent corner rounding.

### Effects tokens

- `--edge-iris` – iridescent conic gradient for edges and focus rings. Defined in the dark base and re-colored for the Aurora theme ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L69-L76), [Aurora override](../src/app/themes.css#L171-L178)).
- `--seg-active-grad` – linear gradient for active segments such as tabs; the Aurora theme swaps in its green-purple spectrum ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L77-L82), [Aurora override](../src/app/themes.css#L179-L184)).
- `--neon` and `--neon-soft` – default glow color for buttons and accents. `--neon-soft` blends the tone for subtle backgrounds and upgrades via `color-mix` when supported ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L48-L49), [color-mix](../src/app/themes.css#L92)).
- `--card-hairline` – low-contrast border used on cards; gains an accent tint when `color-mix` is available ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L55), [color-mix](../src/app/themes.css#L93-L97)).
- `--shadow` – drop shadow for elevated surfaces; Aurora supplies a lighter variant ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L83), [Aurora override](../src/app/themes.css#L185)).
- `--shadow-dropdown` – menu and popover elevation token shared by Tailwind's `shadow-dropdown` utility ([tokens.css](../tokens/tokens.css)).
- `--shadow-neon` – layered neon text glow built from spacing tokens ([themes.css](../src/app/themes.css#L13-L16)).
- `--aurora-g-light` / `--aurora-p-light` – static fallbacks for the aurora gradients when `color-mix` is unavailable. Use them with the `aurora` classes instead of blending alphas manually so the palette remains consistent across browsers.

## Layout and spacing

- Use a 12‑column grid with 24px gutters.
- Spacing tokens: `1`=4px, `2`=8px, `3`=12px, `4`=16px, `5`=24px, `6`=32px, `7`=48px, `8`=64px.
- Wrap page-level content with `.page-shell` or the `<PageShell />` component to get the shared container rhythm: `space-6` on
  small screens, `space-7` at `md`, and `space-8` at `lg`. Add vertical padding per view instead of redefining horizontal
  gutters. The shell's maximum width is governed by `--shell-width`, with `--shell-max` available for per-page overrides ([tokens.css](../tokens/tokens.css), [globals.css](../src/app/globals.css)).
- When pairing a hero header with body content, place the hero inside a `<PageShell as="header">` before the `<PageShell as="main">`. The main shell automatically exposes `id="main-content"` so the "Skip to main content" link lands after the header frame.

## Typography

- Font sizes: 12px for labels, 15px for UI text, 19px for body copy, and 24/30px for titles.
- Tracking: headers `-0.01em`; pills and labels `+0.02em`.
- Use one weight per tier – `500` for UI, `600` for titles.

## Radius and borders

- Corner radii follow an 8/12/16/24px scale; most components use 16px while pills are fully rounded.
- Borders are `1px` solid `hsl(--line/0.35)`; avoid double outlines except on focus rings.

## Texture

- Background scanlines should not exceed `0.08` opacity and grain textures `0.06`.
- Avoid stacking both textures on small components; reserve them for large panels.

## Global styles

- `src/app/globals.css` resets layout, sets typography and applies focus and selection styles.
- Respect the `no-animations` class for reduced motion users. Avoid forcing animations when it is present.

## Icons

- Prefer icons from `lucide-react`.
- Define any custom icons in `src/icons` and import them where needed.
- Avoid embedding raw `<svg>` tags in components. An inline SVG remains in `Hero` for a noise texture background.

## Primitive components

- Reusable building blocks live under `src/components/ui/primitives` (e.g. `Button`, `Badge`, `Input`).
- Prefer composing these primitives rather than creating bespoke styles.
- Variant props are provided for sizing and icon placement where appropriate.
- `Input` fields reuse their generated `id` as the default `name` to avoid
  collisions when several fields share the same label. Supply a custom `name`
  (or `id`) if you need specific form field identifiers.
- Control height is set via a `height` prop that accepts `"sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl"`
  or a control height token (e.g. `var(--control-h-lg)` for large controls). The native `size`
  attribute remains available for setting character width.
- `Button` automatically sizes any `svg` icons based on the `size` option
  and sets icon gaps: `gap-1` for `sm`, `gap-2` for `md`, `gap-3` for `lg`.
- `Button` and `IconButton` share the `variant` options
  `"primary" | "secondary" | "ghost"`. Update any IconButton usage from
  `solid` → `primary`, `glow` → `secondary`, and `ring` → `ghost`.
- When you need the chromatic fill, pick the primary variant (or another
  tone/variant pairing from the gallery) so the accent-tinted backgrounds
  and focus shadows replace the neutral panel treatment.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/primitives/Button";
import { Plus } from "lucide-react";

export function Submit() {
  return (
    <Button size="sm">
      <Plus />
      Save
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Theme system

- `ThemeToggle` (in `src/components/ui/theme`) lets users switch among preset themes and backgrounds while persisting preferences in local storage.
- Apply the provided classes (`bg-intense`, variant names, etc.) to opt into specific theme behavior.

```tsx
import ThemeToggle from "@/components/ui/theme/ThemeToggle";

export function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="flex justify-end p-4">
      <ThemeToggle />
    </header>
  );
}
```

Following these guidelines keeps the interface consistent and lets theme updates propagate automatically.

## Feedback components

### Toast

- Toast surfaces time-sensitive feedback and dismisses itself after `duration` milliseconds.
- Hovering the toast container or focusing any interactive element inside it pauses the auto-dismiss timer until the interaction ends.
- Pass `showProgress` to render a shrinking progress bar that mirrors the remaining time and pauses in sync with hover/focus states.

## Layout components

### Header

- Sticky top bar with a neon underline and high z-index so content scrolls beneath it.
- `tabs` renders a segmented control in the top-right for quick section switching.

### Hero

- HUD-glitch banner built on `Header`.
- `subTabs` adds a secondary segmented tab row; legacy `tabs` prop remains.
- A neon divider forms a neon search row that can host a pill `SearchBar` and optional actions.

## SearchBar

- Wraps its input in a `<form role="search">` for accessibility.
- Submitting the form calls `onValueChange` immediately and optionally `onSubmit` with the current query.
- Disables `autoComplete`, `autoCorrect`, `spellCheck`, and `autoCapitalize` by default for consistent text entry.
- Accepts an optional `label` prop that renders the shared `<Label>` component and wires up `htmlFor`/`id` automatically. When you omit `label`, supply your own `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` as needed.

```tsx
import { SearchBar } from "@/components/ui";

export function Demo() {
  return (
    <SearchBar
      value=""
      onValueChange={() => {}}
      onSubmit={(q) => console.log(q)}
      label="Search tasks"
    />
  );
}
```
